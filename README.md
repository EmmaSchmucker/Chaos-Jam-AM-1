Note on Boss enemies:

I don't know what these Bosses will look like, but their attacks resemble their party-member counterparts. Maybe the enemie on Rabbit island really is a monstrous version of a rabbit, further enforcing the "Who's the Monster?" theme.

Our progress:

Art --- 
* single asset for Fox character (no animation yet)
* Grass background Tileset

Code ---
* project created in Godot 4.4 (latest)
* basic character movement with following party members (having party members who follow Fox is technically a mistake, but if future teams want to make assets for walking bird, frog, and rabbit, characters, this detail could be kept.)

Next Steps:

* Design enemy bosses
* Display Party Member's portraits with Health bars as you walk around
* Berry interaction
* Decide if we will actually do island-based special attacks
* Build specials for Fox when you sacrifice party members

Day 2

ART
Added portraits for the FROG, RABBIT, and BIRD. I also added a small dirt tile for the tile maps. also made an evil ass strawberry. 

For tomorrow
Add the shadows and highlights for the BIRD portrait. Make a Fox portrait. Make More tile sets. Create main asset for the BIRD, RABBIT, and FROG. (This is for putting the character into the world to move around.) Also Import All portraits tomorrow. 
PROGRAM
Made movement 
Fixed syntax errors
Made reusable interaction system and set up the sacrifice interaction with the death berry, however the tua code of the sacrifice will need to be added.
DESIGN/PM
Sketched out the four islands to help future teams visualize what each may look like. 
Mapped out the first map/island, although could use some work.
Made some changes to the game, viewable on the "changes" page on the wiki.
Made sure everything design related for "Phase 1" was complete

For tomorrow
Map out the rest of the levels.
Choose how the story will be told and begin writing it.
Balance and playtest boss fights (since stats are available, even if they aren't in game, use board game pieces), ensure that everything is balanced, possible, and fair.
Determine the Fox's stat growth rate upon each sacrifice.
