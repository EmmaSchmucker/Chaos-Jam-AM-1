Note on Boss enemies:

I don't know what these Bosses will look like, but their attacks resemble their party-member counterparts. Maybe the enemie on Rabbit island really is a monstrous version of a rabbit, further enforcing the "Who's the Monster?" theme.

Our progress:

Art --- 
* single asset for Fox character (no animation yet)
* Grass background Tileset

Code ---
* project created in Godot 4.4 (latest)
* basic character movement with following party members (having party members who follow Fox is technically a mistake, but if future teams want to make assets for walking bird, frog, and rabbit, characters, this detail could be kept.)

Next Steps:

* Design enemy bosses
* Display Party Member's portraits with Health bars as you walk around
* Berry interaction
* Decide if we will actually do island-based special attacks
* Build specials for Fox when you sacrifice party members
