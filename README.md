Our progress:

Art --- 
* single asset for Fox character (no animation yet)

Code ---
* project created in Godot 4.4 (latest)
* basic character movement with following party members (having party members who follow Fox is technically a mistake, but if future teams want to make assets for walking bird, frog, and rabbit, characters, this detail could be kept.)
